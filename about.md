Hi I'm Ricky. I'm a software engineer living and working in London.

This is a personal blog I have created in order to do write ups on some of the software engineering related books I have been reading. The purpose is to help me understand and digest the information through writing and also to serve as a sort of personal archive of my takeaways from these books.

I may also make some posts about some learnings from personal projects I have been working on. These will probably mostly be about rust but could be about anything that takes my fancy really.
