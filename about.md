Hi, I'm Ricky. I'm a software engineer living and working in London.

This is a personal blog I've created for the purpose of posting about some projects and books I have been reading. I've noticed that I often read a good book and forget most of it which makes it pointless. So, I am going to start doing write ups and posting them here to help me digest the information and to serve as a personal information vault.
