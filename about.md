Hi, I'm Ricky. I'm a software engineer living and working in London.

Posts on this blog will be focussed purely on the realm of software and software engineering. Writing about a topic can help to really understand it as well as help spot gaps in knowledge. I have also found that writing helps with tremendously with retaining information.
