Hi, I'm Ricky. I'm a software engineer living and working in London. I take a keen interest in many different topics from databases, distributes systems, programming languages and the art of building software.

I'll be posting on here writings about some stuff I've been learning about in order to help solify knowledge as well as musings related to software engineering.
